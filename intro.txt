To facilitate users to obtain gene related drugs in CTRP database, which includes drug-response data along with response profiles for 481 compounds in 860 cell lines, as well as RNA-seq data, we have developed a web app based on Shiny package including three subpages. 
Gene Related Drugs module allows users to visualize the association between the expression of interested gene and drug response by volcano plot. The association between gene expression and drug-response area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by Pearson’s correlation, with a p < 0.05 considered as significant. Volcano plot of correlation coefficient (x-axis) and –log10 correlation p-value (y-axis) between expression of a given gene in all cell lines and 481 compounds was displayed in this module. Users could personalize the plot by adjusting correlation coefficient and p-value. 
“Expression” could then display the expression level for any gene of interest across all tumor cell lines in CTRP database. Distributions of mRNA gene expression levels are displayed by box plot. All the gene expression values are log2 transformed. Users could get general idea about the distribution for a given gene in different cancer cell lines.
And “Fraction” page visualizes the proportion of responsive drugs by calculating the ratio of drugs with absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.3 and p value less than 0.05 in different cell lines, and defined as resistant group (correlation coefficients >0.3) and sensitivity group (correlation coefficients< −0.3), respectively. Bar plot was then utilized to visualize the ratio distribution of related drugs between these two groups in this module. 
Taken together, this server could aid researchers to find candidate drugs to regulate interested gene expression so that they could design an experiment to study its biological function in vitro.
